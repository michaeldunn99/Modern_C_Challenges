# Pi Approximation

This program approximates the value of pi to a given number of decimal places using the Gauss-Legendre approximation.

## Challenge Posed

      Compute the N first decimal places of Ï€.


## Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)

## How to Compile

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory (Challenges/Ch3-pi)
2. Run the following command to compile the program, noting the command line argument [n] MUST be a positive integer strictly less than 15:

   ```bash
   make pi 
   ```
3. To the run the program, run the command: 
   ```bash
   ./bin/pi [n]
   ```
   where [n] is the chosen number of decimal places (strictly less than 15).
